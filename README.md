# E-commerce Analysis

## Context
An e-commerce company based in the United Kingdom would like to extract some insights from their customer data for the past year. They would like to find out if there are specific areas they should focus on or improve to increase their revenue. They have hired you to help them figure out!

In this notebook we seek to answer a few questions:

1: Sales performance analysis

    What are the sales or revenue trend over time?
    Which countries contributed the most revenue?
    What are the top selling products?
    How many refunds were there?

2: Customer behavior analysis

    How many unique customers were there in the last year?
    Which customers generated the highest revenue?
    Which customers contributed the most refunds?

3: What are some strategies we can utilise to potentially improve sales?

Lets dive into the data!
